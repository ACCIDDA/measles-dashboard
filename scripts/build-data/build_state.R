# Generic imuGAP -> dashboard CSV producer (#20).
#
# State-agnostic: give it a fitted imuGAP object + the standardized
# tidyschoolvax/run_imugap outputs (cleaned_data, linkage_key) + state metadata,
# and it emits the #20 schema:
#   <out>/states.csv                          (one row per state; appended)
#   <out>/states/<slug>.csv                   (one row per county)
#   <out>/states/<slug>/counties/<cty>.csv    (one row per school)
#
# Approach settled in probe_aggregate.R: coverage at every level = predict() at
# that loc_id NODE (state=root, counties=layer2, schools=layer3), grades K-5 =
# ages 5-10 taken as a single-year cross-section via create_target(mode="snapshot").
#
# Modes:
#   FIT_PATH=<rds>            real run (also needs CLEANED_PATH, LINKAGE_PATH, STATE)
#   STUB=1                    join/format test on real inputs w/ placeholder coverage
